# GROWTH SPURT SNAKE

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/A8Nu4eI7lYs

#### Description:

A Snake game created in Lua and Love, with a twist!
This snake will never stop growing, how high of a score can you get?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As soon as the game starts, your green blocksnake wiil start growing and never stop. The score counter increases by one for each red square touched/consumed, and reverts to zero when the snake hits the screen edge or itself. The high score counter stores your highest score as long as the game is running. 

Making all the elements in the game, such as the snake segments and the food, required understanding of OOP principles. I watched Love/Lua tutorials on Snake, and tutorials on objects and classes to improve my knowledge. 

I'm very happy with the progress I have made since starting the course. I've learned the basic principles and feel more comfortable now with creating new projects and learning new languages. Thank you David, and everyone else behind CS50x, as well as the discord community. 

This was CS50x!
